<h3> My Favorite Game: <br>
<h5>Ori and the Blind Forest always takes the cake for me when thinking of my favorite game. It has been my favorite for a couple of years now, and it never gets old to me. The sound and visuals mesh so well together, and completely immerse the player in the world. The game was made by Moon Studios, and published by Microsoft Studios for Windows, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It was first released in March 2015. The game was actually made in Unity!
